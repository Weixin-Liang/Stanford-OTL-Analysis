Computational analysis of 4,512 inventions marketed by Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing between 1970 and 2020 characterizes how the academic innovation landscape changed over time. We identified factors, such as the composition of the inventors, associated with the commercial success of the inventions. We also identified linguistic differences in how high-revenue and low-revenue inventions in the same field are described and marketed.

## Abstract
*Universities play an important role in translating research into practice and commercialization through technology licensing. However, large-scale data science analysis of such translation is limited in the literature. This article systematically investigates the technology licensing by Stanford University. We analyzed all the inventions marketed by Stanford’s Office of Technology Licensing (OTL) between 1970 to 2020, with 4,512 inventions from 6,557 inventors. We quantified how the innovation landscape at Stanford changed over time and examined factors that correlate with commercial success. We found that the most profitable inventions are predominantly licensed by inventors’ own startups, inventions involved larger teams over time, and the proportion of female inventors has tripled over the past 25 years. We also identified linguistic features in how the inventors and OTL describe the inventions that significantly correlate with the invention’s future revenue. Interestingly, inventions with more adjectives in abstracts have worse net income. Our study opens up a new perspective for analyzing the translation of research into practice and commercialization using large-scale computational and linguistics analysis.*
